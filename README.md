# Mountain Biking AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
This project is about making an AI that provides real-time power consumption and usage guidance for mountain bikers. By utilizing data from sensors that measure speed, cadence, incline, heart rate and power output, the AI helps mountain bikers optimize their performance, improve safety and enhance their overall mountain biking experience. 

## Background
More often than not especially unexperienced mountain bikers face challenges optimizing their power output based of varying terrains, leading to fatigue or inefficient riding. This problem is common among all mountain bikers but especially amongst unexperienced ones. In areas with diverse terrain the rider must be aware of their power consumption to be able to ride longer distances.

As a mountain biking enthusiast myself, I understand the struggle of maintaining optimal power output throughout a ride. This project would aim to enhance the riding experience by providing real-time power usage guidance using AI.

This topic is important because mountain biking is a popular sport enjoyed by millions worldwide. Providing real-time power usage and riding guidance using AI can enhance the overall riding expecience, making the ride more enjoyable. AI assistance with power management can also improve rider safety and help in preventing injuries. By optimizing power output based on factors like incline and speed, the AI can help reduce the risk of fatigue- and straining-related injuries. In addition it can be an advantage for more competitive riders looking to improve their skills and outperform opponents in competitions. By analyzing performance metrics and providing personalized recommendations, competitive riders can optimize their power output and technique.

## How is it used?
Before beginning their ride, the user wears the device or opens an app on their smartphone (not quite sure yet what the implementation would look like). The device is activated and AI algorithms start processing data received from sensors that measure different values such as speed, cadence, incline, heart rate and power output. 

The device analyzes data in real-time and reviews current riding conditions and rider performance. Based on the analyzed data, the device provides real-time guidance and recommendations to the rider. The guidance may include suggestions to increase or decrease power output, adjust riding technique or prepare for upcoming terrain changes. The recommendations are adapting to changes in the environment and other factors. For example when approaching a steep uphill climb, the device recommends increasing power output to maintain speed for the climb. Or in situations where the rider is descending, the device recommends to conserve energy by reducing power output. 

The device or app is designed to be used in various environments typical for mountain biking such as trails with diverse terrain with varying weather conditions and different times of day.

Primary users of this solution are mountain bikers of all skill levels from beginners to experienced professionals. It serves the diverse needs of all users including improving performance, enhancing safety, preventing fatigue- and straining-related injuries and maximizing users enjoyment during the ride.

## Data sources and AI methods
The data used in the solutions are collected from users themselves. When developing the solution some test runs are probably needed which means that different types of riders would have to go for mountain bike rides wearing a device that measures different values. The riders would have to be different from each other in terms of body weight, height, skill level, etc. to be sure that the test data is diverse enough.

## Challenges
One of the primary challenges with this implementation is the accuracy of the AI's predictions and suggestions. There is always a possibility that the AI might make incorrect recommendations, which needs to be considered during development. Riders should not blindly follow all AI recommendations without question and must be aware of their own physical limits. For instance, if a rider feels exhausted and the AI suggests increasing power output on an incline, the rider should prioritize their wellbeing and ignore the AI's recommendation. Ensuring that the AI serves as a guide rather than an absolute authority is crucial to maintaining rider safety and preventing injuries.

## What next?
Right now my project is just a shell or an idea of something that could possibly be done. I do not have enough knowledge of software development or AI to finish this kind of project, so firstly I would need to develop my own skills in the field or find people around me who are capable of doing something like this.
